It was asked to solve a regression ML problem on some real data about car accident insurance. 

During the Hackathon we have used some different Machine Learning methods that can be seen in the following files:

1.  __`sus5.ipynb`__: 
This file contains the pipeline used to solve the problem. It presents the preprocessing (except for the None filling) and the model selection phase.

2.  __`sus5.R`__: 
This R file was useful to fill the missing data of our dataset. We filled them with the knn method. 

3.  __`train.csv`__ and __`test.csv`__: 
These are the datasets for the test and validation part
